`openpilot` is a comprehensive Rust crate designed to assist in building fully autonomous vehicles. The primary focus of this crate is to provide tools for constructing and simulating sensor models, and GPS sensors, and implementing Extended Kalman Filters (EKF). The library includes modules tailored for managing sensor readings, simple sensors, GPS sensors, and features a high-performance 1D Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) implementation.

In addition to these foundational functionalities, `openpilot` introduces the `selfdrive` package. This package is specifically designed for autonomous vehicle control, providing modules and structs that facilitate object tracking, cluster management, and detailed lead vehicle analysis.

## ü¶Ä Why Rust?

Choosing Rust for `openpilot` is like strapping a jet engine to your autonomous vehicle's code. Rust brings a level of memory safety and concurrency control that turns potential coding nightmares into a serene drive through bug-free landscapes. With its high-performance 1D Extended Kalman Filter and modules tailored for sensor management and autonomous control, `openpilot` in Rust isn't just a toolbox; it's the James Bond of autonomous vehicle development. So, why Rust? Because when your code is navigating the streets, you want a language that won't just drive, it'll drive with the precision of a surgical robot and the reliability of a Swiss watch. Welcome to the fast lane of autonomy, where Rust is the steering wheel that ensures you reach your destination, bug-free and in style.

## üöÄ Quick Start

Get started with the `openpilot` library by following these simple steps:

1. Install the `openpilot` crate by adding the following line to your `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[dependencies]
openpilot = "0.0.4"
```

1. Import the necessary modules and use the provided functionality in your Rust project:

```rust
use ndarray::arr2;
use openpilot::common::ext_kal_fltr::{SensorReading, SimpleSensor, GPS, EKF, FastEKF1D};
use openpilot::selfdrive::controls::radar_helpers::{Track, Cluster, Lead};

fn main() {
    // Example usage
    let data = arr2(&[[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]]);
    let obs_model = arr2(&[[1.0, 0.0], [0.0, 1.0]]);
    let covar = arr2(&[[0.1, 0.0], [0.0, 0.1]]);
    let sensor_reading = SensorReading::new(data.clone(), obs_model.clone(), covar.clone());

    // Create a simple sensor
    let simple_sensor = SimpleSensor::new(obs_model.clone(), covar.clone(), 2);
    let reading = simple_sensor.read(data.clone(), None);
    println!("Simple Sensor Reading: {:?}", reading);

    // Create a GPS sensor
    let gps_sensor = GPS::new((0, 1), 2, 0.01);
    let latlon = &[37.7749, -122.4194];
    let reading = gps_sensor.read(latlon, None);
    println!("GPS Sensor Reading: {:?}", reading);

    // Create and use a fast 1D Extended Kalman Filter
    let mut fast_ekf_1d = FastEKF1D::new(0.1, 0.01, 0.001);
    fast_ekf_1d.update_scalar(&sensor_reading);
    fast_ekf_1d.predict(0.1);
    let (tf, tfj) = fast_ekf_1d.calc_transfer_fun(0.1);
    println!("EKF Transfer Function: {:?}, Jacobian: {:?}", tf, tfj);

    // Use Track, Cluster, and Lead structs and functions
    let mut track = Track::new();
    track.update(10.0, -5.0, 20.0, 15.0, 30.0, 0.1, 0.5, 0.5, 15.0, 20.0, 10.0);
    let key = track.get_key_for_cluster();
    println!("Track Key for Cluster: {:?}", key);

    let mut cluster = Cluster::new();
    let track1 = Track::new();
    let track2 = Track::new();
    cluster.add(track1);
    cluster.add(track2);
    let d_rel = cluster.d_rel();
    println!("Cluster Relative Distance: {:?}", d_rel);

    let mut lead = Lead {
        d_rel: 0.0,
        y_rel: 0.0,
        v_rel: 0.0,
        a_rel: 0.0,
        v_lead: 0.0,
        a_lead: 0.0,
        d_path: 0.0,
        v_lat: 0.0,
        v_lead_k: 0.0,
        a_lead_k: 0.0,
        status: false,
        fcw: true,
    };
    cluster.to_live20(&mut lead);
    println!("Lead Vehicle Information: {:?}", lead);
}
```
